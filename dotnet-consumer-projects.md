# .NET Open Source Consumer Projects

There are many .NET based open source consumer projects. You can always use a search engine to find projects, and that's a good approach. This list is an intended to provide a showcase for projects that want it. It is intended to be community maintained. PR a change in and it will be accepted (modulo duplicates). Projects should be sorted alphabetically and project source links and product website are allowed. This list could include desktop applications, websites, mobile apps, etc.

This list is just a starting point - also take a look at all the projects on [CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/) and on [GitHub Trending C#](https://github.com/trending?l=csharp).

Thanks to @scottisafool for providing the initial list.
